# Who is Giovanni Moscato ? 

[About me](https://medium.com/@_GMDev/how-to-start-coding-for-noobs-best-guide-ever-32fd51514f07)

<p>Graduated from Northern Illinois University with a B.S in computer science ( specifically computational programming ) and minor in mathematics.

My dream career would involve combing technology and art together to create experiences that users ( and developers ) really love.

At the moment I have a decent range of experience in programming and design aspects.
Currently I am trying to figure out what area of programming I'd like to specialize in.</p>
